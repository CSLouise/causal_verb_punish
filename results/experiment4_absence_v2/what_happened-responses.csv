535,physical,Technically everyone is to blame. Tommy for not putting the safety cap back on. Suzy for not handing the scissors carefully to Andy or noticing the safety cap was gone. Even Andy for not noticing the safety cap was missing before taking the scissors. ,"Technically the scissors hurt Andy, not an actual person. However otherwise you could argue that everyone hurt Andy, including Andy himself, since everyone shares blame. Otherwise you could also argue that only Andy is to blame since he should watch out for himself and not everyone else.","The manufacturer of the wand to have such a dumb toy that can shock children. What a design flaw. id' say none of the kids are really to blame. 

Otherwise you could say everyone is to blame. Ben for not noticing the star was missing. Kate for not noticing the star was missing, and Amy for not putting the star back on the wand to begin with.","You could argue that Ben shocked himself by not noticing the wand was missing the star, as he should only try to be responsible for himself first. ",
525,physical,"If i had to select one person, I would choose Tommy because his action of leaving the safety cap off the scissors led to a chain of events that resulted in Andy getting hurt.",I think Suzy hurt Andy by accidentally handing him the scissors with the unprotected sharp ends pointed toward him.,"As I stated previously, if I had to select one person as the cause of Ben being shocked, I would choose Amy. This is because if her action of removing the star off the wand did not occur, Ben would not have been shocked. However, I feel the case could be made that all 3 children played a part in causing Ben to be shocked.  Kate handed Ben the wand, although Ben asked for it. Ben also willingly took the wand into his hand. ","I think it depends on how someone perceives the situation. If I had to pick one person, I would have to say Amy, because her action of not replacing the star back onto the wand was the first action in the chain of events that eventually led to Ben being shocked. If Amy had not removed the star, Ben would have never been shocked. If I didn't have to select only one person to blame, I would say that each of the 3 children could be partially blamed. Kate shocked Ben by handing him the wand, although neither Kate nor Ben seemed to realize the risk of the exposed wires. Also, Kate handed the wand to Ben because he asked for it. Ben also took the wand into his hand on his own accord. ",

The first kid should have put the cap back on the scissors and Suzy did not have the proper training to handle scissors in the safe manner of passing it to another individual.

Tommy was careless and left the scissors without the safety cap. And both Andy and Susie were careless in the passing of the scissors, which led to Andy being hurt. None of them know the proper way to handle scissors, apparently, which is also the teacher's fault (and their parents').","Nobody hurt Andy, Andy got hurt by accident.",The manufacturer of the wand caused Ben to be shocked. They should not have made the wand so that removing the star leaves live wires sticking out the end. Obviously none of the children (and probably not the teacher) knew that this would happen if the star was removed and someone kept playing with the wand.,The wand shocked Ben. No one knew that this would be the result of playing with the wand without the star.,
